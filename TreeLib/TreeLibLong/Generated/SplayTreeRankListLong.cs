        //"Splay trees", or "self-adjusting search trees" are a simple and
        //efficient data structure for storing an ordered set. The data
        //structure consists of a binary tree, without parent pointers, and no
        //additional fields. It allows searching, insertion, deletion,
        //deletemin, deletemax, splitting, joining, and many other operations,
        //all with amortized logarithmic performance. Since the trees adapt to
        //the sequence of requests, their performance on real access patterns is

        //and papers [1,2,3,4,5].

        //The chief modification here is that the splay operation works even if the
        //item being splayed is not in the tree, and even if the tree root of the
        //tree is NULL. So the line:
        //
        //                          t = splay(i, t);
        //
        //causes it to search for item with key i in the tree rooted at t. If it's
        //there, it is splayed to the root. If it isn't there, then the node put
        //at the root is the last one before NULL that would have been reached in a
        //normal binary search for i. (It's a neighbor of i in the tree.) This
        //allows many other operations to be easily implemented, as shown below.
