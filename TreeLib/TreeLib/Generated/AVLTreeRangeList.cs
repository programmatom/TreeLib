        //   the next GC, so the references do not cause memory leaks, and we can avoid having to zero 'path' after an operation.
        // - If the tree is infrequently used, the 'path' array does not need to be kept around. This is especially useful if there
        //   are many trees, as each tree instance has it's own instance of 'path'.
